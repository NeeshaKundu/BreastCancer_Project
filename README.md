# BreastCancer_Project
BreasCancer project using python and power bi

objectives of this project are:

Diagnostic Prediction: Diagnostic prediction involves using data-driven models, such as machine learning algorithms, to predict the presence or absence of a particular condition or disease based on patient data and medical records.

 Risk Assessment: Analyzing patient data to estimate the risk or probability of certain health outcomes.

 Effectiveness: Determining the effectiveness of a specific treatment or intervention based on patient data and outcomes.

Recurrence: Predicting the likelihood of disease recurrence after treatment completion using patient data and survival analysis techniques.

 Survival Analysis: Analyzing patient data to estimate the probability of patient survival after diagnosis or treatment initiation.

models used in this project are:

Logistic Regression : Diagnostic Prediction and Risk Assessment. 

 Decision Tree : Effectiveness and Survival Analysis.

 Support Vector Machine : Recurrence.

 Cox Proportional Hazard : Survival Analysis.
